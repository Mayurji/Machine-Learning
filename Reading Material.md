## Email Classification :

#### First  phase  of  the  algorithm  will  comprise  of development  of  a  dictionary. When  a  new  email arrives, email  text  is  extracted initially  and  words are classified into non-negative and negative words. Next, verb  words  are  removed  and  plural  words  are converted  into  singular  words.  After  this  step propositions, pronouns, interjections, conjunctions are also removed. 

#### In  removing  redundant  words,  a  synonyms  lookup table is utilized to consider all synonyms as one word, so that the probabilities for all of them are aggregated and it will  make  the  classification  process  more  precise. WordNet  is  a good  source for  extracting  the synonyms data.
