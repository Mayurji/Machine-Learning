### Multiple Linear Regression :

A Multiple Linear regression Model consists of more than one Independent variable and a Dependent variable.

In Multiple Linear Regression Model, We have more than one Independent variable based on which we will
predict our dependent variable.The Dataset we have here is "50_StartUp.csv", where Profit is a
dependent variable which depends on expenditure of a startup, marketing or R&D and other factors.

Here, Multiple Linear Regression Model can also known as Polynomial Regression Model.

Equation : y = (a0 + a1 * X0 + a2 X1 + ......)where a0, a1, a2,.... are coefficients and X0,X1,... are Independent 
variables and y is our dependent variable.
