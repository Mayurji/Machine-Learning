### Support Vector Regression

Support Vector Regression is a regression technique which indeed has many other kernel in itself i.e. we can apply
SVR on Linear Models and Non Linear Model using Kernel trick. There are different kernel trick as follows:

* RBF
* Poly
* Linear
* Sigmoid

Each of the kernel has its own significance.
