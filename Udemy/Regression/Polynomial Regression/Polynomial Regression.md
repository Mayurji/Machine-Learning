### Polynomial Regression :

A Polynomial Regression Model consists of more than one Independent variable and a Dependent variable.
It is combination of both Linear and Multiple Linear Model either one indpendent but different variant 
of one variable itself or more than one independent variable.

In Polynomial Regression Model, We have more than one Independent variable based on which we will
predict our dependent variable.The Dataset we have here is "50_StartUp.csv", where Profit is a
dependent variable which depends on expenditure such as Marketing cost or R&D cost etc.

Equation : y = a0 + a1 * X1 + a2 * X1^2 + a3 * X1^3...... where a0, a1, a2 are coefficients and X1,X1^2... are Independent variable and
y is our dependent variable.
