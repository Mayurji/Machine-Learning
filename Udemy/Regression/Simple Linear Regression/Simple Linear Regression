### Simple Linear Regression :

A Simple Machine Learning Model consists of a Independent variable and Dependent variable.

In Simple Linear Regression Model, We have one Independent variable based on which we will
predict our dependent variable.The Dataset we have here is "Salary.csv", where Salary is a
dependent variable which depends on experience.

Equation : y = a0 + a1 * X where a0 & a1 are coefficients and X is Independent variable and
y is our dependent variable.
