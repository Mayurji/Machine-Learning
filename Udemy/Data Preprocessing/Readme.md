### Data Preprocessing:

Every Machine Learning Model requires us to preprocess the data set before applying the Machine Learning Model on the dataset.
Here we have few techniques which are applied generally to preprocess the dataset as follows :

* Handling Categorical Data
* One-Hot Encoder on Categorical Data
* LabelEncoder on Categorical Data
* Feature Scaling
* Handling Missing Data
* Splitting Dataset as required.
